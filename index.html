I am a SWE with over a decade of programming &amp; system design experience.<br/>Over the next few years I&#x27;ll be starting various web 3 projects.<br/>I want to start these projects under a pseudonym with no traces back to my real identity.<br/>So, to remain anonymous, I&#x27;m asking you to help bootstrap my wallet in exchange for some pre-ICO tokens of my first project.<br/>I&#x27;m collecting 400 SOL in exchange for 5% (1050000) of the total supply of the first project&#x27;s tokens<!-- -->.<br/>For my first project, I&#x27;ll be building a DeCLOB on top of Orca Whirlpools.<br/>Orca is winning the liquidity competition while Open Book is hardly innovating, leaving an opening for a product such as this.<br/>What will set this product apart is a high class real-time order book UX available both for desktop browsers and Solana mobile.</h2></hgroup><section class="container" style="background-color:none;margin:0 auto;max-width:550px"><div></div></section><article data-theme="light"><form class="grid"><label for="send">Send SOL:<input type="number" id="send" name="send" aria-label="Send Sol" required="" max="5" min="0.1" step="0.1" style="background-color:white" value="1"/></label><label for="get">Receive DLMT:<input readonly="" value="2625"/></label><button type="submit">Connect Wallet</button></form></article></header></div><div class="container"><h3>Terms of Deal</h3><p>The first 400 SOL sent to my address<!-- --> <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/address/9Mi32KJbNY3U7kfB8A1Uv8KMukRBa6JKcMYLZSizS6g">9Mi32KJbNY3U7kfB8A1Uv8KMukRBa6JKcMYLZSizS6g</a> <!-- -->will get

                    There will be future raises but probably at a much higher market cap once the project is actually live.</p><p><b>DO NOT send me very much SOL!</b> <!-- -->I would much prefer many people get involved in this project so I can ask you all questions on twitter to help guide product development.

Mainly it will allow users to place limit orders on Orca Whirlpools but I might include Raydium concentrated liquidity too.
                    I do plan on having some kind of Web 3 Labs group which has a token that extracts value from all the Labs&#x27; child projects,
                    but the details on this aren&#x27;t clear to me yet. Bootstrapers will be given a way to gain ownership in this meta project as well as the initial project.
                    Here are my planned projects (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>On-chain limit order book aggregating concetrated liquidity dexes: delimit.sol</li><li>Solana-based gitopia competitor: degit.sol</li><li>Web 3 persistent world mmorts game: imagine age of empires + factorio + evony</li><li>On-chain ETFs and NFT funds (web 3 REITs), controlled by DAO and/or algorithmically (BlackRock, Vanguard competitor)</li></ul></div><div class="container"><h3>Project Tokenomics</h3><p>All the projects will have the same tokenomics:</p><ul><li>21 million max supply</li><li>Deflationary. Every dapp tx causes small amount of supply to be bought &amp; burnt so token captures revenue over time. In the stock market, companies are valued based on current or future projected cash flow which in theory is/will be returned to shareholders as dividends or stock buybacks. Tokens should do the same, otherwise I find it difficult to justify why a token should have any value.</li><li>21% goes to founder (me) locked for several years (might be standard 4 year vest w/ 1 year cliff that begins after ICO to be held at future date). 29% is reserved for employee incentives and private raises. 50% goes to public through offers like this or through smart contract ICO-like offerings.</li></ul><p>These tokenomics are not finalized. I&#x27;m sharing it here moreso to give bootstrappers and idea of my general approach to fundraising, value capture, and allocation.</p></div><div class="container"><h3>Bootstrap Progress: <!-- -->loading...</h3><p>Bootstrapers Leaderboard:</p><ul></ul></div><div class="container"><h3>Got Questions/Feedback?</h3><p>Follow my twitter for updates, questions, comments, and suggestions:<!-- --> <a href="https://twitter.com/decartesol">@<!-- -->decartesol</a></p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"HBh-3-EkrF3lSvzaYJrF3","assetPrefix":"/bootstrap-offer","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
