Over the next few years I'll be starting some web 3 projects. I want to start these under a pseudonym w/ no traces to my real identity, so I'm asking you to help bootstrap my wallet.

All the projects will have the same tokenomics:
- 21 million max supply
- deflationary. every dapp tx causes small amount of supply to be bought & burnt so token captures revenue over time
- 21% goes to founder (me) locked for several years (might be standard 4 year vest w/ 1 year cliff that begins after ICO to be held at future date). 29% is reserved for employee incentives and private raises. 50% goes to public through offers like this or through smart contract ICO-like offerings.

First project is a dex aggregator. Can't say more than that until I have something working on mainnet.

The first 400 SOL sent to my address [9Mi32KJbNY3U7kfB8A1Uv8KMukRBa6JKcMYLZSizS6g](https://explorer.solana.com/address/9Mi32KJbNY3U7kfB8A1Uv8KMukRBa6JKcMYLZSizS6g) will get 5% of the first project's supply (so for example if you send 4 SOL you'll get back 10500 tokens). Deal will no longer apply after 400 SOL has been received. There'll be future raises but probably at a much higher mcap once the project is actually live.

I'll post a twitter account for you all to follow once I can buy relevant .sol domains.

Don't send me much. I'd prefer multiple people get invested in this so I can ask you all questions on twitter to help guide product development. I also don't want a ton of death threats from overly invested folks in the event a project fails / is cancelled.
